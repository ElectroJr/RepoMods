This is a repository for any mods I make for (R.E.P.O)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/], which currently only consists of a single client-side UI mod that allows you to see what upgrades other players have, with the goal of making it easier to figure out how to distribute upgrades.

Requires (unity-mod-manager)[github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager] to load the mod.
